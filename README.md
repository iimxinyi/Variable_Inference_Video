# VideoGenSteps
### Experimental Setup
We conduct real experiments to explore the relationship between inference steps and the video quality.
The experimental platform is built on Ubuntu 20.04 system with an Intel Xeon Platinum 8358 CPU and an NVIDIA RTX A800 GPU.
We use Open-Sora-Plan v1.1.0 as an examplified model of Large Vision Models.

### Experimental Design
The detailed experimental process is as follows. First, we randomly select 5 officially provided prompts, assign 10 random seeds for each prompt, and generate videos using 15 different inference steps ranging from 10 to 80. This setup results in a total of 750 videos.
